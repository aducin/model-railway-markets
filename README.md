# model-railway-markets
Model-railway-markets project has been designed as an agenda of the railway modellers markets in Central Europe.

Beside the homepage and the bookmark "Modele-ad9bis" (both are static) there are some separated bookmarks - each of them contains informations about dates and places in specific country (Germany is devided into eastern and western part). Displayed data is stored in the MySQL database (supported by Doctrine2).

The agenda is already available to customers of the Modele-Ad9bis on-line store (http://modele-ad9bis.pl/ - bookmark: "Terminarz gie≈Çd modelarskich").
At the bottom of every page there is a contact form that allows to get further information about the Modele-Ad9bis on-line store offer.

The project is based on the PHP Symfony2 framework.

Other technologies used in the project:
- Doctrine2 Object Relational Mapper
- Twig template engine
- JavaScript
